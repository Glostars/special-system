Organized confusion 
There is something to be said when your security camra
 captures image's of people in cloaks, that are not
 really there. 
I started to pay close attention and also take my own
 photos. 
I have many images of paranormal events. I have
 numerous recordings as well. My earliest memory as 
a child is seeing shadow people every night. 
As a child I
 studied what it was these beings were up to, and I 
concluded that they are watching and copying us. As an 
adult I begin to wonder why these were my memories, 
so I began to study the brain. I found that if your 
brain is in the development stages and you are not 
able to stimulate it, (such as a abused child not 
allowed to leave her room) then it will cause you to 
hallucinate. That was the answer I had searched for
 and accepted. Then one night,as a adult,
my mind was forever changed. There is something to
 consider in the light/dark.
